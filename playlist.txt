- Californication Red Hot Chilli Peppers 

Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams it's Californication
It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East at least it's settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin, or is that war you're waging?
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication
Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station To Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication
Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there and I don't mean on vacation
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving?
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

- Under the bridge Red Hot Chilli Peppers

Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, the city of angels
Lonely as I am, together we cry
I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie
I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love, the city, she loves me
Lonely as I am, together we cry
I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, no, no-no, yeah, yeah
Love me, I say, yeah yeah
One time
Is where I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown)
I could not get enough
(Under the bridge downtown)
Forgot about my love
(Under the bridge downtown)
I gave my life away
Yeah, yeah
Oh, no, no-no-no, yeah, yeah
Oh, no, I said, oh, yeah, yeah
Where I stay

- Yellow Coldplay

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called Yellow
So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow
your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
(Ooh) turn into something beautiful
(Ah) and you know, you know I love you so
You know I love you so
I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow
And your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
(Ooh) turn into something beautiful
(Ah) and you know, for you, I'd bleed myself dry
For you, I'd bleed myself dry
It's true
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for...
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do

Paradise Coldplay

When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
Dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes
When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly
Dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
She'd dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Sing, la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
And so lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, "oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know the sun must set to rise"
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh, oh
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
This could be para, be paradise
Para-paradise
Para-paradise
This could be para, be paradise
Para-paradise
Para-paradise


- Starboy The Weekend

I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb' just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yeah
Main bitch outta your league too, ah
Side bitch out of your league too, ah
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearing aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah
Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah
Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah
Coming for the king, that's a far cry, ah
I come alive in the fall time, I
The competition, I don't really listen
I'm in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearing aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
A hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearing aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

- Borderline Tame Impala

Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
How was I to know?
How was I to know this high came rushing?

We're on the borderline
Dangerously fine and unforgiving
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday

Here I go
Quite a show for a loner in LA
I wonder how I managed to end up in this place
Where I couldn't get away

On the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time
Watched it speedin' by like a train
Like a train

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Any closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be so in love?
Any closer, close enough
Shout out to what is done
RIP, here comes the Sun
Here comes the Sun

Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
Rudy said it's fine
They used to do this all the time in college (if you and I get comfortable)

And we're on the borderline (ooh)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time
Watched it speedin' by like a train

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Any closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be so in love?
Any closer, close enough
Shout out to what is done
RIP, here comes the Sun

- More than a woman Bee Gees

Oh, girl, I've known you very well
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just tryin' to keep a hold on you
Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now, I think I would die
Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking 'bout those people then
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love, I know I would die
Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman (ooh, my baby)
More than a woman to me
Hey
More than a woman
More than a woman to me (oh, so much more)
More than a woman (oh, baby)
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman

- Love me again John Newman

Know I've done wrong, left your heart torn
Is that what devils do?
Took you so low, where only fools go
I shook the angel in you
Now I'm rising from the ground
Rising up to you
Filled with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can't do
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
Can you love me again?
It's unforgivable
I stole and burnt your soul
Is that what demons do?
They rule the worst of me
Destroy everything
They bring down angels like you
Now I'm rising from the ground
Rising up to you
Filled with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can't do
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
Can you love me again?
Oh, I told you once again
I can't do this again, do this again, oh
I told you once again
I can't do this again, do this again, oh no
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again (Oh, oh)
Can you love me again?
Can you love me again?
Can you love me again?

- A sky full of stars Coldplay

'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause you light up the path
I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, oo-oo, oo-oo
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars (full of stars)
I wanna die in your arms, oh, oh
'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark (gets dark)
I'm gonna give you my heart, oh
I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, oo-oo, oo-oo
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you
'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh


- Viva la vida Coldplay

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Podés mirar, baby, test me, investigarme
No' vemo' flotando en Argentina, ah

- Leave the door open Bruno Mars y Silk Sonic

Say baby, say baby, say baby

Oh, you got plans? (You got plans?)
Don't say that (shut yo' trap)

To be alone (woo-hoo)
My house clean (house clean)
My pool warm (pool warm)
Just shaved (smooth like a newborn)
We should be dancing, romancing, in the east wing
And the west wing of this mansion, what's happenin'?

Every word that I say
Is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms

And if you're hungry, girl, I got filets (woo-hoo)
Ooh, baby, don't keep me (waiting)
There's so much love we could be making (shamone)
