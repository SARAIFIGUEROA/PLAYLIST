        <p>Know I've done wrong, left your heart tornb<br>
            Is that what devils do?<br>
            Took you so low, where only fools go<br>
            I shook the angel in you</p>

        <p>Now I'm rising from the ground<br>
            Rising up to you<br>
            Filled with all the strength I found<br>
            There's nothing I can't do</p>

        <p>I need to know now, know now<br>
            Can you love me again?<br>
            I need to know now, know now<br>
            Can you love me again?<br>
            I need to know now, know now<br>
            Can you love me again?<br>
            I need to know now, know now<br>
            Can you love me again?<br>
            Can you love me again?</p>

        <p>It's unforgivable<br>
            I stole and burnt your soul<br>
            Is that what demons do?</p>

        <p>They rule the worst of me<br>
            Destroy everything<br>
            They bring down angels like you</p>

        <p>Now I'm rising from the ground<br>
            Rising up to you<br>
            Filled with all the strength I found<br>
            There's nothing I can't do</p>

        <p>I need to know now, know now<br>
            Can you love me again?<br>
            I need to know now, know now<br>
            Can you love me again?</p>

        <p>Oh, I told you once again<br>
            I can't do this again, do this again, oh<br>
            I told you once again<br>
            I can't do this again, do this again, oh no</p>

        <p>I need to know now, know now<br>
            Can you love me again?<br>
            I need to know now, know now<br>
            Can you love me again?<br>
            I need to know now, know now<br>
            Can you love me again (Oh, oh)</p>
        <p>Can you love me again?<br>
            Can you love me again?<br>
            Can you love me again?</p>
