    <p>I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah<br>
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah<br>
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah<br>
All red Lamb' just to tease you, ah<br>
None of these toys on lease too, ah<br>
Made your whole year in a week too, yeah<br>
Main bitch outta your league too, ah<br>
Side bitch out of your league too, ah</p>

<p>House so empty, need a centerpiece<br>
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony<br>
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces<br>
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah<br>
You talkin' money, need a hearing aid<br>
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade<br>
Switch up my style, I take any lane<br>
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain</p>

<p>Look what you've done<bR>
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy<br>
Look what you've done<br>
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy</p>

<p>Every day a nigga try to test me, ah<br>
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah<br>
Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah<br>
Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah<br>
Coming for the king, that's a far cry, ah<br>
I come alive in the fall time, I<br>
The competition, I don't really listen<br>
I'm in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition</p>

<p>House so empty, need a centerpiece<br>
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony<br>
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces<br>
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah<br>
You talkin' money, need a hearing aid<br>
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade<br>
Switch up my style, I take any lane<br>
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain</p>

<p>Look what you've done<br>
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy<br>
Look what you've done<br>
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy</p>

<p>Let a nigga brag Pitt<br>
Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit<br>
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon<br>
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish<br>
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan<br>
Girls get loose when they hear this song<br>
A hundred on the dash get me close to God<br>
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars</p>

<p>House so empty, need a centerpiece<br>
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony<br>
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces<br>
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah<br>
You talkin' money, need a hearing aid<br>
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade<br>
Switch up my style, I take any lane<br>
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain</p>

<p>Look what you've done<br>
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy<br>
Look what you've done<br>
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy<br>
Look what you've done<br>
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy<br>
Look what you've done<br>
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy</p>
