    <p>Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner<br>
        Sometimes I feel like my only friend<br>
        Is the city I live in, the city of angels<br>
        Lonely as I am, together we cry<br>
        I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion<br>
        I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am<br>
        She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy<br>
        Well, I never worry, now that is a lie</p>

       <p>I don't ever wanna feel<br>
        Like I did that day<br>
        Take me to the place I love<br>
        Take me all the way<br>
        I don't ever wanna feel<br>
        Like I did that day<br>
        Take me to the place I love<br>
        Take me all the way<br>
        Yeah, yeah, yeah</p>

       <p>It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there<br>
        It's hard to believe that I'm all alone<br>
        At least I have her love, the city, she loves me<br>
        Lonely as I am, together we cry</p>

        <p>I don't ever wanna feel<br>
        Like I did that day<br>
        Take me to the place I love<br>
        Take me all the way<br>
        I don't ever wanna feel<br>
        Like I did that day<br>
        Take me to the place I love<br>
        Take me all the way<br>
        Yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
        Oh, no, no-no, yeah, yeah<br>
        Love me, I say, yeah yeah</p>

       <p>One time</p>

       <p>Is where I drew some blood<br>
        (Under the bridge downtown)<br>
        I could not get enough<br>
        (Under the bridge downtown)<br>
        Forgot about my love<br>
        (Under the bridge downtown)<br>
        I gave my life away<br>
        Yeah, yeah<br>
        Oh, no, no-no-no, yeah, yeah<br>
        Oh, no, I said, oh, yeah, yeah<br>
        Where I stay<br>
