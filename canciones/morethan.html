    <p>Oh, girl, I've known you very well<br>
        I've seen you growing every day<br>
        I never really looked before<br>
        But now you take my breath away<br>
        Suddenly you're in my life<br>
        Part of everything I do<br>
        You got me working day and night<br>
        Just tryin' to keep a hold on you</p>

    <p>Here in your arms I found my paradise<br>
        My only chance for happiness<br>
        And if I lose you now, I think I would die<br>
        Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine<br>
        We can take forever, just a minute at a time</p>

    <p>More than a woman<br>
        More than a woman to me<br>
        More than a woman<br>
        More than a woman to me</p>

    <p>There are stories old and true<br>
        Of people so in love like you and me<br>
        And I can see myself<br>
        Let history repeat itself<br>
        Reflecting how I feel for you<br>
        Thinking 'bout those people then<br>
        I know that in a thousand years<br>
        I'd fall in love with you again</p>

    <p>This is the only way that we should fly<br>
        This is the only way to go<br>
        And if I lose your love, I know I would die<br>
        Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine<br>
        We can take forever, just a minute at a time</p>

    <p>More than a woman<br>
        More than a woman to me<br>
        More than a woman (ooh, my baby)<br>
        More than a woman to me<br>
    </p>

    <p>Hey<br>
        More than a woman<br>
        More than a woman to me (oh, so much more)<br>
        More than a woman (oh, baby)<br>
        More than a woman to me</p>
    <p>More than a woman<br>
        More than a woman to me<br>
        More than a woman<br>
        More than a woman to me<br>
        More than a woman</p>
