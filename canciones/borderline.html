    <p>Gone a little far<br>
        Gone a little far this time or somethin'<br>
        How was I to know?<br>
        How was I to know this high came rushing?</p>

    <p>We're on the borderline<br>
        Dangerously fine and unforgiving<br>
        Possibly a sign<br>
        I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday</p>

    <p>Here I go<br>
        Quite a show for a loner in L.A.<br>
        I wonder I managed to end up in this place<br>
        Where I couldn't get away></p>

    <p>We're on the borderline<br>
        Caught between the tides of pain and rapture<br>
        Then I saw the time<br>
        Watched it speedin' by like a train<br>
        Like a train</p>

    <p>Will I be known and loved?<br>
        Is there one that I trust?<br>
        Starting to sober up<br>
        Has it been long enough?<br>
        Will I be known and loved?<br>
        Little closer, close enough<br>
        I'm a loser, loosen up<br>
        Setting free, must be tough </p>

    <p>Will I be known and loved?<br>
        Is there one that I trust?<br>
        Starting to sober up<br>
        Has it been long enough?<br>
        Will I be so in love?<br>
        Any closer, close enough<br>
        Shout out to what is done<br>
        R.I.P. here comes the sun<br>
        Here comes the sun<br>
    </p>

    <p>Gone a little far<br>
        Gone a little far this time with something<br>
        Who'd have said it's fine?<br>
        They used to do this all the time in college </p>

    <p>And we're on the borderline<br>
        Caught between the tides of pain and rapture<br>
        Then I saw the time<br>
        Watched it speedin' by like a train</p>

    <p>Will I be known and loved?<br>
        Is there one that I trust?<br>

        Will I be known and loved?<br>
