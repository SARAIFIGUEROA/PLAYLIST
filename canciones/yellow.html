    <p> Look at the stars<br>
        Look how they shine for you<br>
        And everything you do<br>
        Yeah, they were all yellow</p>

        <p>I came along<br>
        I wrote a song for you<br>
        And all the things you do<br>
        And it was called Yellow</p>

        <p>So then I took my turn<br>
        Oh, what a thing to have done<br>
        And it was all yellow</p>

       <p> your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones<br>
        (Ooh) turn into something beautiful<br>
        (Ah) and you know, you know I love you so<br>
        You know I love you so</p>

       <p>I swam across<br>
        I jumped across for you<br>
        Oh, what a thing to do<br>
        'Cause you were all yellow</p>

        <p>I drew a line<br>
        I drew a line for you<br>
        Oh, what a thing to do<br>
        And it was all yellow</p>

        <p>And your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones<br>
        (Ooh) turn into something beautiful<br>
        (Ah) and you know, for you, I'd bleed myself dry<br>
        For you, I'd bleed myself dry</p>

       <p> It's true<br>
        Look how they shine for you<br>
        Look how they shine for you<br>
        Look how they shine for...<br>
        Look how they shine for you<br>
        Look how they shine for you<br>
        Look how they shine</p>

       <p> Look at the stars<br>
        Look how they shine for you<br>
        And all the things that you do </p>
